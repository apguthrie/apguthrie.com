Welcome! I am a research scientist working within Virginia Tech's Center for Biostatistics and Health Data Science. I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Virginia Tech in August of 2023, where my research focused on creating synthetic populations for agent-based models. While a student at Virginia Tech, I worked for several years as a statistical consultant at the Statistical Applications and Innovations Group ([SAIG](https://saig.stat.vt.edu/ "SAIG Homepage")), where I collaborated on dozens of graduate student theses and dissertations. I have also taught several short courses on the R programming language through Virginia Tech's Technology-Enhanced Learning and Online Strategies ([TLOS](https://tlos.vt.edu/ "TLOS Homepage")), covering topics such as "Basics of R", "Data Manipulation in R", "Graphics in Base R", and "Graphics in R using `ggplot2`".

Outside of work, I am huge fan of ice hockey, having played since I was 11 years old. I enjoy bicycling (mainly mountain biking), hiking, and I have a minor addiction to what are called *variant* or *hybrid* Sudoku puzzles. If you love Sudoku, but find classic puzzles too easy, I strongly recommend looking into these!
