Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech graduating in May 2025.  My research has focused on boldness-recalibration which appropriately emboldens probability predictions to the extent that they are also accurate while maintaining calibration.  The goal of this is to produce more actionable forecasts.  Check out our open access article on this work in [the American Statistician](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/metrics/10.1080/00031305.2024.2339266?scroll=top). I've also developed software for boldness-recalibration and related methodology in the [BRcal R package on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BRcal). 

My broader research interests include (but are not limited to) probability calibration and boldness, Bayesian statistics, computational statistical, optimization, statistical consulting, spatial statistics, and statistical modeling in sports, environmental science, social science, and animal science.
