Welcome!  I am currently an Assistant Professor in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. I received my PhD (May 2025) and MS (May 2021) in Statistics from Virginia Tech and my BS in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from Millersville University of Pennsylvania.  My research has focused on boldness-recalibration which appropriately emboldens probability predictions to the extent that they are also accurate while maintaining calibration.  The goal of this is to produce more actionable forecasts.  Check out our open access article on this work in [the American Statistician](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/metrics/10.1080/00031305.2024.2339266?scroll=top). I've also developed software for boldness-recalibration and related methodology in the [BRcal R package on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BRcal). 

My broader research interests include (but are not limited to) probability calibration and boldness, Bayesian statistics, computational statistical, optimization, statistical consulting, spatial statistics, and statistical modeling in sports, environmental science, social science, and animal science.
