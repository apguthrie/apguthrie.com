Abstract
======
When probability predictions are too cautious for decision making, boldness-recalibration enables responsible emboldening while maintaining the probability of calibration required by the user. We introduce BRcal, an R package implementing boldness-recalibration and supporting methodology as recently proposed. The BRcal package provides direct control of the calibration-boldness tradeoff and visualizes how different calibration levels change individual predictions. We describe the implementation details in BRcal related to non-linear optimization of boldness with a non-linear inequality constraint on calibration. Package functionality is demonstrated via a real world case study involving housing foreclosure predictions. The BRcal package is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BRcal/index.html) and on Github (https://github.com/apguthrie/BRcal).
