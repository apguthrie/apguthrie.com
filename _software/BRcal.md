Abstract
======
Boldness-recalibration maximally spreads out probability predictions while maintaining a user specified level of calibration, facilitated the `brcal()` function. Supporting functions to assess calibration via Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) recalibration, Linear in Log Odds (LLO)-adjust via any specified parameters, and visualize results are also provided. Methodological details can be found in [Guthrie & Franck (2024)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2024.2339266).
